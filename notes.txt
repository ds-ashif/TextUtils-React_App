JSX:  JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code inside your JavaScript code. It makes writing React components easier and more readable.

Why is JSX useful?
Readability: JSX makes the code easier to read and write because it looks like HTML.
Integration: It allows you to mix HTML structure and JavaScript logic in the same file, which is useful in React for defining UI components.

in jsx:
class-> className
for= htmlFor
tab= tabIndex


react app k function me sirf ek hi tag hota h like div agr ek se jyada hoga then error aaega
-->To use more than one tag,we have to use JSX fragment "<> </>" close evry tag in jsx fragment.


JSX is compiled by BABEL: babel compiles jsx down to React.createElement() calls.



props:
Props (short for properties) are like function arguments in React. They allow you to pass data from one component to another.

📌 How Props Work (Simple Example)
Imagine you have a Greeting component that should display a name. Instead of hardcoding the name, you can pass it as a prop.

Example: Using Props

function Greeting(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
    return <Greeting name="Alice" />;
}

🔹 Breaking it Down:
Greeting is a component that accepts props.
props.name is used inside Greeting to display a dynamic name.
In App, we pass "Alice" as a prop (name="Alice").
The output will be:
"Hello, Alice!"
🔥 Key Things to Remember About Props:
✔️ Props pass data from a parent component to a child.
✔️ Props are read-only (cannot be modified inside the child component).
✔️ They help make components reusable.


proptypes---> string,array,object,number,link...
we can provide default props to function if no prop is set in our App.jsx then that default props will be shown

Navbar.propTypes = {
    title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    abouttxt: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

.isRequired:: to assure that some props have set either custom or default but if neither of them is set then it cause error 
so we use .isRequired to ensure that props are passed.
